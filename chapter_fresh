In the summer in 2014, I was recruitted in to the Danfod university beacause of my extraordianry graduation score from my high school. I had know about SH, but I also know little about it. I knwo it is a famous and high-level commercial city in this world, people here are rich and equiped with high education, and there are many key universities here. Many fa=mous people live here and chase their great dreams here, They want to make there dream come true, they want to let their thesis become the bible upvoted by thousands and hundreds people. I merely know that this is a city.every is tedious, rivial, I lost my dream and my ambiton to become the one nourished a world of culture. This also make me steped into the abyss of low efficiency and losting enthuastism for my daily life, I would rather sleep on the bed every day frme time to time, from a ambitious man to coward. Life is hard and life is also full of challenges, but if you lost the purpose of becoming a better person ,you wil lost everything without any conservation of waht you insiting a very long time. Life is a monster who chase you so nearly that you have to run, fight, or you will be killed or be washed by the poision of your lazyness and terrible hobbies.
